# See docs/DB_REFRESH.md for setup. Companion: refresh-long-tables.sh (the LONG-column tables,

#
# NOT `set -e`: Data Pump returns exit 5 ("completed with errors") for the harmless
# "object already exists" noise on a replace; that is success for our purposes.

# ADMIN LOGIN RESTORE — this refresh WIPES the ABIS admin login.
#
# schemas=DBO + table_exists_action=replace overwrites every DBO table that isn't excluded, and
# SECURITY_USER / SECURITY_GROUP / SECURITY_APPLICATION / SECURITY_USER_GROUP do NOT match the
# 'ABIS%' exclude — so they are replaced by PROD's copies, deleting any admin that existed only
# on .230 (e.g. cmattinson). Symptom: "user not found" at the ABIS sign-in.
#
# NOTE the asymmetry: abis_user_credential DOES match 'ABIS%' and therefore SURVIVES. It is keyed
# by login_id (not user_id), so once the security_user row is recreated with the same login the
# EXISTING PASSWORD WORKS AGAIN — no password reset is needed. AD/LDAP mode is unaffected either
# way (AD verifies the password; ABIS still needs the security_user row for identity + RBAC).
#
# This runs on the DB host, but the fix is an API call against the ABIS app host — hence opt-in:
# set ABIS_ADMIN_LOGIN + BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN (+ ABIS_BASE / ABIS_API_KEY) to auto-restore. Otherwise
# the exact command is printed so the next person isn't left guessing.
#
# (Alternative, if you would rather .230 keep its OWN user list across refreshes: add
#  exclude=TABLE:"LIKE 'SECURITY%'" to the parfile above. That trades prod-realistic RBAC data
#  for a stable non-prod login. Left off by default so .230 keeps mirroring prod.)
# --- restore the IT group's full grants (automatic) -----------------------------------------
# Same cause as the admin restore below, different table: SECURITY_GROUP_APPLICATION is a DBO table
# and does not match the 'ABIS%' exclude, so prod's copy replaces it and the IT group reverts.
#
# This one needs no opt-in, unlike the admin restore. That is an API call to the app host and can
# only be a suggestion from here; this is plain SQL against the database this script is already
# connected to, so it just runs. The symptom it prevents is a 403 on a screen that looks available,
# which reads like a bug in the page rather than a missing grant.
#
# NOT done at app startup, deliberately. The sequence self-heal can run on every boot because a
# sequence behind its max is always wrong. A GRANT is policy: if the plant later decides to narrow
# what IT holds, an app that re-widened it on every restart would silently overrule them and fight
# the admin screens. Repairing it where the damage is caused keeps that decision the plant's.

*** ACTION REQUIRED: the ABIS admin login was just wiped *******************************
  This refresh replaced SECURITY_USER/_GROUP/_APPLICATION/_USER_GROUP with prod's copies,
  removing any admin that lived only on .230. Sign-in will fail with "user not found".

  Restore it on the ABIS app host (codi-ABIS):
      sudo ./tools/bootstrap-admin.sh <loginId> "First" "Last"

  The existing password still works afterwards (abis_user_credential survives, keyed by
  login_id). To automate this next time, set ABIS_ADMIN_LOGIN + BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN (and
  ABIS_BASE / ABIS_API_KEY if the API is not on this host).
