-- resync_sequences.sql — advance each DBO id sequence to MAX(id)+1 of the table it feeds.
--
-- WHY: after a Data Pump refresh of the non-prod DB (.230) from prod (.9), the transactional
-- sequences land BEHIND their imported table data — the export is not sequence-consistent, so
-- NEXTVAL returns a value that already exists and every id-minting INSERT fails with ORA-00001
-- (unique constraint violated). Confirmed 2026-07-24: 13 of 18 sequences behind, COIL_ABC_NUM_SEQ
-- by 877,220. Low-churn config sequences (customer/carrier/die/sketch) drift slowly and were fine.
--
-- This is the mandatory post-refresh step. It is idempotent (a sequence already ahead is skipped)
-- and safe to re-run. Oracle 11g-compatible: it uses the INCREMENT BY jump rather than 12c RESTART.
--
-- RUN AS DBO on the target DB. Read the password from the app host's env rather than typing it -
-- and do NOT paste `dbo/<pw>@...` literally: bash reads `<pw>` as a redirect and answers
-- "pw: No such file or directory" before sqlplus is ever reached.
--   PW=$(sed -n 's/.*[Pp]assword=\([^;"]*\).*/\1/p' /etc/abis/abis.env | head -1)
--   sqlplus -S /nolog <<EOF
--   CONNECT dbo/$PW@//192.168.1.230:1521/abc11
--   @tools/resync_sequences.sql
--   EOF
-- READ-ONLY DRY RUN: set p_apply := FALSE below to only report the gaps without altering anything.
