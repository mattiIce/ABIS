#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bootstrap-admin.sh — give an ABIS login FULL WRITE access (member of every group + write on every
# feature), and ensure the features the modern app gates on exist at all. Idempotent; safe to re-run.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   A prod -> non-prod DB copy via Oracle Data Pump with TABLE_EXISTS_ACTION=REPLACE overwrites the
#   SECURITY_* tables with prod's, which WIPES any admin user/grant that lived only on the non-prod box
#   (e.g. "cmattinson"). After such a refresh the admin can no longer sign in / reach the console. Re-run
#   this script to restore an admin login. It authenticates with the service API key, which BYPASSES RBAC,
#   so it can bootstrap access even when no admin grant currently exists.
#
# SCOPE / SAFETY
#   Writes ONLY to the ABIS SECURITY_* tables of whatever database the local API is pointed at (normally
#   the non-prod box). It fires no EDI, runs no report, and never touches a prod DB host. See
#   docs/ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP.md. This is deliberately a BROAD grant meant for an operator/admin account — for
#   an ordinary user, assign specific groups/features in the Security UI instead.
#
# PRIVILEGE MODEL
#   Per feature, a user's effective privilege = MAX(direct grant, group grants); 0 = read-only, 1 = write.
#   Granting write (1) directly on every feature guarantees full write regardless of how any group is set.
#
# USAGE
#   sudo ./bootstrap-admin.sh <loginId> ["First"] ["Last"]
#   ./bootstrap-admin.sh cmattinson Codi Mattinson
#   BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8080 ENV_FILE=/etc/abis/abis.env API_KEY=... ./bootstrap-admin.sh cmattinson
#
# ENV OVERRIDES
#   BASE      API base URL              (default http://127.0.0.1:8080)
#   ENV_FILE  systemd EnvironmentFile   (default /etc/abis/abis.env) — read for ApiKeys__Keys__0
#   API_KEY   API key                   (default: parsed from ENV_FILE)

# 2b) Ensure the features the MODERN app gates on actually exist.
#
# The 35 rows in SECURITY_APPLICATION are the LEGACY app's vocabulary. The modernization gates on
# four names that were never added to it, so they can never be granted — and the failure is silent
# and misleading:
#   Part Number       hides the Parts page AND 403s every part write
#   Scheduler Admin   hides Admin & scheduler — and makes the dashboard card read
#                     "Registry not provisioned", which looks like missing tables and is not
#   Server Admin      hides Server console
#   Maintenance_logs  403s every maintenance/PM write (reads are ungated, so the page looks fine
#                     until you try to save)
#
# Creating them here rather than as a one-off migration is deliberate: the weekly .230 refresh
# REPLACES SECURITY_* from prod (see docs/DB_REFRESH.md Part 4), so a manual insert would be wiped
# every week exactly like the admin login. Doing it in the same script that already runs after a
# refresh makes both self-healing. Adding a feature grants nobody anything on its own — step 3 does
# that — so this is safe to run anywhere.
#
# Since 2026-08-21 the APP also restores these four on every startup
# (AbisSchema.EnsureRequiredFeaturesAsync, DB_REFRESH.md Part 6), so this step is usually a no-op
# now. It stays because this script must work on a box where the app has not started yet, and
# because RequiredFeatureTests keeps the two lists from drifting apart.
