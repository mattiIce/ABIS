-- Give the IT group Write on every ABIS feature.
--
-- WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS
-- The plant's instruction (2026-08-05) is that IT holds full read/write/modify on every component of
-- ABIS. It was applied on .230, but a Data Pump refresh imports every DBO table except the ABIS_*
-- modernization ones — and SECURITY_GROUP_APPLICATION is a DBO table. So the refresh silently reverts
-- it to whatever prod has, exactly like the admin login that Part 3 of the refresh runbook restores.
-- Run this after every refresh, alongside that step.
--
-- WHAT IT DOES
-- Ensures one row per (IT group, feature) at privilege 1 (Write). Idempotent: an existing grant is
-- raised to Write, a missing one is inserted, and nothing else is touched. It never removes a grant
-- and never touches another group.
--
-- SAFETY
-- Non-prod (.230) only. Prod (.9) is read-only by policy — do NOT run this there. Legacy owns the
-- production security tables and changing them is a plant decision made through legacy ABIS.
--
--   PW=$(sed -n 's/.*[Pp]assword=\([^;"]*\).*/\1/p' /etc/abis/abis.env | head -1)
--   sqlplus -S /nolog <<EOF
--   CONNECT dbo/$PW@192.168.1.230:1521/abc11
--   @tools/grant_it_group.sql
--   EOF
--
-- Do NOT paste `dbo/<pw>@...` literally: bash reads `<pw>` as a redirect and answers
-- "pw: No such file or directory" before sqlplus is ever reached.
