# Parity Guard Worklist (legacy → modern enforceable rules)

Source: the `parity-guard-discovery` workflow (2026-07-08) mined 21 vendored legacy
subsystems for enforceable business-rule guards, adversarially confirmed each against the
current API (293 gaps), and consolidated them into the 32 ranked items below. Each was
re-verified against the legacy source + current code before implementing.

**Branch:** `claude/parity-integrity-guards` (off `main` @ PR #82). Rhythm: verify each item
vs legacy + current code → implement → test → commit one at a time. Before pushing the batch,
regenerate the OpenAPI snapshot (`cd api && dotnet tool run swagger tofile --output
openapi.snapshot.json src/ABIS.Api/bin/Release/net8.0/ABIS.Api.dll v1`) and open a PR.

Status key: ✅ done · ⬜ todo (offline-now) · ⏸ deferred (needs live Oracle / unbuilt subsystem)

**Recommended remaining order:** 6 (finished-job guard, codes verified job 0=Done), 4 (transfer provenance, low-risk), 3+9 (security), 10+20 (part/die validation), 8+11 (order-item/skid bounds), 14 (empty-mint), 15 (dim bounds), then the M-effort ones (12,19,22,24,25). Verify skid status 0=GONE (rank 5) and the SheetSkidWrite bounds against legacy before enforcing.

**Progress (2026-07-08).** Landed on `main` via PR #83: ranks 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,11,14,15.
On PR #84 (`claude/parity-guards-2`, CI green): ranks **10,12,16,17,19,20,21,22,23**.
**Remaining offline-now:** **18** (shift uniqueness per line/schedule/date, M/med),
**24** (cert-label completeness + heavy-gauge advisory, M/low — customer-conditional +
advisory, less clean to hard-enforce), **25** (trim-override provenance from principal
[clean] + tolerance config/band + system_log audit [defer]). **Deferred (live Oracle /
bigger):** 8 (order-finalize), 13, and the sub-parts noted per row above; ranks 26-32
are unbuilt subsystems. **Snapshot gotcha:** always `rm -rf src/ABIS.Api/bin/Release
src/ABIS.Api/obj/Release` before `swagger tofile` — an incremental Release build can be
stale and silently emit an old contract (this bit rank 22/12; fixed in a follow-up).
